Developed a feature-rich To-Do app using the MERN stack, enabling users to efficiently manage tasks. The application offers intuitive interfaces for creating, updating, and deleting tasks. Leveraged MongoDB for robust data storage, Express.js and Node.js for seamless server-side operations, and React.js for a dynamic, responsive user experience. Focused on ensuring high performance and user-friendly interactions without including user authentication.

Backend contains a .env file which I have not shared for security reasons which have sensible information like :
PORT = 6001

DB_URI = 

JWT_SECRET = 

JWT_EXPIRE = 

WEB_URL = 

LOCAL_URL = 

Once you have all the necessary variables set in, the code will be running perfectly fine.
